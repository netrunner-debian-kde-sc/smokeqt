smokeqt (4:4.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ David Palacio ]
  * Remove patch reduced-linking.diff, applied upstream.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Generate libraries shlibs based on the current version.
  * Tighten the various libraries dependencies to the current version.
  * Drop version for the smoke-dev-tools dependency of libsmokeqt4-dev;
    the right version will be picked because of the stricter libsmokebase
    (indirect) dependency.
  * Bump the smoke-dev-tools build-dependency to 4.7.1.
  * Manually export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags now,
    as dpkg-buildpackage does not do that anymore.
